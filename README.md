# Media Archive Sorting

## Introduction
This project is meant as a playground to test out new features from the recent scala 3 release.
The use case should be familiar with every hobby photographer that lacks some dicipline in organizing his digital media archive.


## Ideas
1. Recursively list images and videos in a folder
2. Collect data regarding creation time and time clusters ( created on an evening / a weekend / two weeks of vacation)
3. Remove duplicated media files ( identified by name and creation time)
4. Display current folder structure in a minified way in the terminal
5. Create a optimized structure based on clusters and time by keeping meaningful folder names
6. Move files on hard drive to implement the new structure
